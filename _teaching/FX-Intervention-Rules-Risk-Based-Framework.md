The lecture intorduces a novel framework for foreign exchange intervention based on Value at Risk, enabling central banks to intervene effectively in the market

Motivation
======

The global financial system is continuously evolving, and macroeconomic events often have a significant impact on it. The FX market is the most liquid and volatile, and information and uncertainties spread quickly through it. Central banks face risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations and must manage these risks to cope with market volatility effectively. They must be equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools to act and intervene in the market when necessary.

This course aims to equip participants with the skills and knowledge required to manage the risks associated with FX effectively. Participants will learn a novel framework for foreign exchange intervention based on the concept of Value at Risk, designed to preserve financial stability in floating exchange rate arrangements.

By attending this course, participants will gain a deeper understanding of key statistical concepts on time series econometrics and volatility modeling essential to design strategies for foreign exchange interventions. They will also have the opportunity to work with experienced IMF consultants and quantitative researchers to apply their newfound knowledge on real-world data simulating credible scenarios of intervention.

The practical skills developed in this course will be invaluable to central bankers and policymakers, enabling them to intervene effectively in the market and gain practical skills that can be immediately applied in their roles.

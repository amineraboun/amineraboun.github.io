Motivation
======

This is an introductory course designed for students with a strong background in mathematics, quantitative modeling, econometrics, and machine learning who are interested in pursuing a career in finance. The course is designed to equip students with the necessary knowledge to contribute effectively in their next role in the financial industry.

The course is designed around a series of conferences featuring industry experts who possess extensive experience and specialized in key topics. The course introduces a novel perspective on the financial system, portraying it as a network of intermediaries where agents and market participants inherit, re-structure, and exchange various types of risk. As financial markets are complex ecosystems with inputs and outputs, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of their operation. This course covers all aspects of the financial industry that are not typically addressed in traditional courses, with the objective of providing students with critical information about their future environment.

   3. Structured Products: Investment Banks offers & Investors needs: This module covers the various structured products offered by investment banks and the needs of investors who use them.
   4. Risk Management at the Scale of an Investment Bank: This module examines the various risks faced by investment banks and the strategies used to manage them.
   5. Post 2008 Crisis Regulation: This module covers the regulatory changes that were implemented following the 2008 financial crisis.
   6. The Investment Process in a Changing World: This module explores the investment process in a changing world, including the use of technology and alternative data.
   7. AI and the Financial System: Will Intermediaries be Disintermediated? This module examines the role of artificial intelligence in the financial system and its potential to disrupt traditional intermediaries.

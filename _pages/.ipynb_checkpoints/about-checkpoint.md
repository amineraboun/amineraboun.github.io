Welcome to my website. I am a Buy Side Quantitative Researcher at Abu Dhabi Investment Authority's (ADIA) Strategy and Planning Division.

My primary role involves developing systematic trading strategies using a scientific approach that harnesses the power of big data, statistics, and machine learning techniques. This entails utilizing quantitative methods to analyze and interpret market trends, risk factors, and other pertinent data points in order to create robust and capacitive investment strategies.

My research interests lie at the intersection of two areas: Asset Allocation, and Market Microstructure

  - Marcroeconomics, Alternative Risk Premia, Smart Beta
  - Transaction Costs, Liquidity, Flows and Crowding

By combining my expertise in economics, mathematics, and finance, I strive to understand how these complex areas interrelate and influence each other, thereby contributing to the development of robust and innovative investment strategies.

I have a PhD in Economics from Université Paris Dauphine, PSL Research University, and two Master's degrees in Applied Mathematics to Finance from Ecole Polytechnique and Télécom ParisTech.
